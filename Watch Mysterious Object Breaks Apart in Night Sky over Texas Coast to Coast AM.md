Watch: Mysterious Object Breaks Apart in Night Sky over Texas
=============================================================

November 10, 2024

_By Alec Fernandes_

A meteor, space debris, and UFOs – witnesses have many theories about what caused a series of streaking lights high above Texas on Saturday night.

Videos emerging on social media show an object hitting Earth's atmosphere and burning up, leaving several fiery trails in its wake. While the US is experiencing two meteor showers this week – the Southern and Northern Taurids – [meteorologists at WFAA](https://www.wfaa.com/article/weather/meteor-shower-dallas-saturday-night-fort-worth-north-texas/287-92f6cbf5-a54b-4225-8228-563077010c9a) in Dallas claim last night's display was more likely from space debris.

[According to NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/headquarters/library/find/bibliographies/space-debris/), our planet's Low Earth Orbit is "now viewed as the world's largest garbage dump," weighing in at 6,000 tons. This pile of rotating rubbish doesn't even include the thousands of working satellites circling the globe, with SpaceX's Elon Musk recently announcing his plan to [launch 30,000 more](https://www.independent.co.uk/space/elon-musk-starlink-satellites-space-b2632941.html).

Despite these odds pointing to something from this world falling out of orbit, some believe the object was extraterrestrial in origin. As stated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS-TL35yzdY), officials have not yet determined the nature of this cosmic spectacle.
